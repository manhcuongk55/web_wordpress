== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Verity includes support for Jetpack's Infinite Scroll and Site Logos, as well as other features.


== Portfolio (requires Jetpack: jetpack.me) ==

Verity helps you showcase your company's work as portfolio projects. Each project is displayed with its featured image and additional information is displayed on hover.

Once you've added some portfolio projects to your website, they will be visible at http://yourgroovysite.wordpress.com/portfolio.

You can also apply Verity's Portfolio Template to a page, which allows visitors to sort your creative works by Project Type. The Portfolio Template will display up to 120 projects.


== Testimonials (requires Jetpack: jetpack.me) ==

Add testimonials to your Lodestar website to share what others have been saying about your work. You can view the testimonial archive by adding /testimonial to your URL.

You can also apply Verity's Testimonial Template to display your testimonials on any page of the site.


== Custom Menus ==

Verity includes one Custom Menu in the header, which can be configured via My Sites → Menus. If no menu is assigned, this area will display a list of your pages by default.


== Social Links Menu (requires Jetpack: jetpack.com) ==

With Verity, you have the option to display links to your social media profiles in the header and footer. To display them, set up a Social Links Menu.


== Widget Areas ==

Verity offers five widget areas:

* The optional Sidebar, which appears on the right/left on all posts and pages, excluding the front page.
* Four optional Footer widget areas.

If the Sidebar area is not active, the theme automatically adjusts to have a single column.


== Site Logo ==

Brand identity is very important — that’s why Verity supports the Site Logo feature. To add your own image, go to Customize → Site Identity. The logo will appear in the header, above the site title.


== Custom Background ==

Custom color, pattern, or a beautiful image – the choice is yours. To change the background, visit Customize → Colors & Backgrounds from your dashboard.

== Classic Menu ==
If you are using Classic Menu, make sure you just add few menus so that the menu does not become two lines. This can create design issues.
